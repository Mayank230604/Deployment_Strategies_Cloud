# Deployment Strategies of Cloud

## Introduction

To begin, let's clarify what the cloud and cloud computing are before diving into deployment strategies. The cloud refers to computing resources such as storage, RAM, CPU, and networking that are delivered over the internet. Cloud computing, on the other hand, involves utilizing these on-demand resources for tasks like deploying applications without the need for physical hardware. This approach ensures accessibility, scalability, observability, reliability, and security.

Cloud computing operates on three primary models:

### 1. IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service):

* **Definition:** IaaS provides the foundational building blocks for cloud IT, including networking, virtual or dedicated hardware, and data storage.
* **Key Features:**
    * On-demand computing resources.
    * Scalability and elasticity.
    * Full control over the infrastructure.
* **Examples:** AWS EC2, AWS S3, AWS VPC.
* **Use Cases:** Hosting websites, running virtual machines, and storing large datasets.

### 2. PAAS (Platform as a Service):

* **Definition:** PaaS offers a platform for developing, deploying, and managing applications without handling the underlying infrastructure.
* **Key Features:**
    * The cloud provider manages the operating system, middleware, and runtime.
    * Users manage applications and data.
* **Examples:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS RDS.
* **Use Cases:** Developing and deploying web applications, managing databases.

### 3. SAAS (Software as a Service):

* **Definition:** SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
* **Key Features:**
    * The cloud provider manages everything, including infrastructure, platform, and application.
    * Users simply access the software.
* **Examples:** AWS Marketplace AMIs, Dropbox.
* **Use Cases:** Ready-to-use applications like CRM tools, email services, and file storage.

## Types of Cloud

### 1. Public Cloud:

* A public cloud is a model where third-party providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure own and operate computing resources, which are shared among multiple users over the internet.
* **Key Features:**
    * Shared resources among multiple users.
    * Used by companies like Netflix, Gmail, and Dropbox.

    * **Cost-Effective:** No need to invest in physical hardware.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Limited control over infrastructure.
    * Potential security and compliance concerns.

### 2. Private Cloud:

* A private cloud is a model where resources are exclusively used by a single organization, offering greater control, security, and customization. It is ideal for businesses with strict data security and compliance requirements.
* **Key Features:**
    * Full control over resources and hardware.
    * **Examples:** OpenStack, VMware.
* **Advantages:**
    * **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** Full control over resources and hardware.
    * **Security:** Enhanced security due to exclusive access.
    * **Performance:** No resource sharing ensures better performance.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * High initial investment.
    * Limited scalability compared to public clouds.
